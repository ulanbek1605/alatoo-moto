This is due to the high workload, customs clearance complexities, frequent regulation changes, and differences in the laws of destination countries. Because of these factors, we cannot guarantee a completely smooth process, so we have decided to discontinue this service. Instead, we offer a long-term parking service. You can store your motorcycle and continue your journey next year, fully rested and refreshed. Our parking facility is monitored 24/7 by CCTV."

We recommend using a hydration system integrated into a small backpack, such as those from Enduristan or other reliable brands.\nThe soil in Central Asia contains fine quartz dust that can cause severe engine damage. To prevent this, make sure to clean your air filters regularly and avoid costly repairs."

Never agree to pay large fines in USD!\n\nIf officers attempt to pressure you for money, use the time-delay tactic:\n\n- Act as if you are in no hurry.\n- Say that you only have local currency.\n- Pretend you do not understand a single word.\n\nRemaining calm and patient is your best strategy!"

	"best_time": {
	  "title": "When is the best time to travel in Kyrgyzstan?",
	  "content": "The season starts at the end of April to the beginning of May. Osh is located at an altitude of 1000 meters, and the passes, which are at high altitudes, can remain snowed in until the end of June. The Kazarman-Jalalabad pass usually opens at the beginning of June. May and June are great for riding at lower altitudes when it‚Äôs not too hot yet.\n\nThe best time, in my opinion, is late summer, from the end of August to September. During this period, it‚Äôs no longer too hot around Osh, the mountains are free of snow, the weather is mostly sunny, with no landslides, and the temperature is comfortable‚Äîbetween 10¬∞ to 20¬∞C during the day and 0¬∞ to 5¬∞C at night."

This crossing is only for Kyrgyz and Tajik nationals.\n\nKyzyl Bel: This is the recommended crossing from Batken.
