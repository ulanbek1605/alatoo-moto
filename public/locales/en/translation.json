Because of these factors, we cannot guarantee a completely smooth process, so we have decided to discontinue this service. Instead, we offer a long-term parking service. You can store your motorcycle and continue your journey next year, fully rested and refreshed. Our parking facility is monitored 24/7 by CCTV."

		"content": "When traveling through this arid region, it is crucial to stay hydrated. We recommend using a hydration system integrated into a small backpack, such as those from Enduristan or other reliable brands.\nThe soil in Central Asia contains fine quartz dust that can cause severe engine damage. To prevent this, make sure to clean your air filters regularly and avoid costly repairs."

At Alatoo-moto, renting a motorcycle assumes that you know how to change tires and inner tubes on your own.\n\nWe provide phone assistance and evacuation services, but keep in mind:\n\n- There is no mobile coverage in many areas.\n- Evacuation is only available within inhabited regions.\n- In most cases, local help with a pack animal will be your best option."

	"police": {
		"title": "Dealing with the Police",
		"content": "Kyrgyzstan is notorious for its high level of corruption. Traffic police often stop foreigners, but by law, they have no right to seize your driver’s license or demand money. Never agree to pay large fines in USD!\n\nIf officers attempt to pressure you for money, use the time-delay tactic:\n\n- Act as if you are in no hurry.\n- Say that you only have local currency.\n- Pretend you do not understand a single word.\n\nRemaining calm and patient is your best strategy!"

	"best_time": {
		"title": "When is the best time to travel in Kyrgyzstan?",
		"content": "The season starts at the end of April to the beginning of May. Osh is located at an altitude of 1000 meters, and the passes, which are at high altitudes, can remain snowed in until the end of June. The Kazarman-Jalalabad pass usually opens at the beginning of June. May and June are great for riding at lower altitudes when it’s not too hot yet.\n\nThe best time, in my opinion, is late summer, from the end of August to September. During this period, it’s no longer too hot around Osh, the mountains are free of snow, the weather is mostly sunny, with no landslides, and the temperature is comfortable—between 10° to 20°C during the day and 0° to 5°C at night."

This crossing is only for Kyrgyz and Tajik nationals.\n\nKyzyl Bel: This is the recommended crossing from Batken. The process is fairly straightforward, but expect some delays due to frequent power outages and slow-moving guards on the Kyrgyz side."

If you feel unsafe, don’t stop or leave immediately.\n- Be constantly aware of your surroundings and monitor them closely.\n- Talk to other motorcyclists along the road and in guesthouses.\n- If you're camping in nature, try to stay away from the road where no one can see you (but always clean up after yourself)."
